### Milestone 1 Feedback
Very cool idea for PWP - I'm really looking forward to seeing this project take shape. Keep in mind that the scope of PWP is pretty narrow - a single, static web page with a contact form - and time will be a big constraint. Apply the 80/20 rule to your content and design ideas - we won't have time to do really big things here, but of course anything goes after graduation. This idea can easily expand far beyond the scope of PWP, so think of this project as a first iteration/working prototype. Down the line you may want to look into a proper CMS solution for a concept like this.

Image galleries are totally do-able, and students will typically use a JavaScript-driven 3rd-party library ("plugin") to create them. I'll give some suggestions when the time comes. Tip: I would limit the number of gallery/slideshow/media items to a very reasonable number due to time constraints. No databases or WordPress-style interactive functionality will be used to manage media here - it will be done by you by hand.

Your project and files are all set up to spec, but there are some problems with your code. Your HTML structure is way off. Please see Edits &amp; Suggestions below for more details, and please spend some time and review the basic HTML document structure.

Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier II](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You are now clear to begin work on Milestone 2&alpha;.

#### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- Review the basic HTML document structure here: https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/class-materials/html/. Your HTML is missing a DOCTYPE, `<head>` and `<body>`. All of the HTML you created should go inside the `<body>`.
- There are issues with your indentation and formatting - be careful to keep this correct. When a div closes, open the next one on a separate line. Not on the same line.
